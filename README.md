# Python-Binary-Battle
It's a simple game where a player competes against a robot named Jarvis. They choose between "0" and "1". The robot's choice is based on the player's past selections. The game ends when a player reaches a score of 10. The final message shows if the player won or lost, and the buttons are disabled. The scores are displayed using a progress bar and the message is displayed using HTML.
